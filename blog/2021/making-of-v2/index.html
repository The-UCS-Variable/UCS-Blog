I had been planning on redesigning the layout for few months before I actually <a href=https://github.com/U-C-S/u-c-s.github.io/commit/3df7524aabdce0d97ae426079af9d3e8cba8fa3a>started</a> working on it. I began with designing the layout using pure HTML, CSS. Intial layout ideas looked good, so, I started putting more effort on styling of it. Meanwhile, Web-Components caught my eye. They looked interesting alternative to React.js. So, I planned on using them to build the site.<p>Then, I discovered about Static Site Generators from JAMStack.org which is quite a surprise to me because I was purely mistaken what SSG actually meant previously. I also started to check out how blog websites are built by others like rust blog, etc. Soon, It started to make sense what "Static Site Generators" are.</article></main><footer><p>A Article by Chanakya</footer>
